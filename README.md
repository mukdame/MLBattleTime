## What is Machine Learning?

#### Machine Learning: 
a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. <br>
by Arthur Samuel (1959). 

## Alogorithms
1. Supervised learning (given results)
   <ul>
    <li>Linear Regression</li>
    <li>Logistic Regression</li>
    <li>Neural Network</li>
    <li>Backpropagation</li>
    <li>SVM: Support Vector Machines</li>
   </ul> 

2. Unsupervised learning (not given results)
   <ul>
    <li>Anomaly Detection</li>
    <li>PCA: Principle Component Analysi</li>
    <li>K-means</li>
   </ul>
